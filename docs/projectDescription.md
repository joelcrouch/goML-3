# High-Performance Data Pipeline Orchestrator (Refactored Consensus Core)

## Project Overview & Technical Specification

ðŸŽ¯ **What This System Actually Does**
The Data Pipeline Orchestrator is a **research-grade distributed control plane** that coordinates the movement and processing of large-scale ML training data across multiple compute nodes in a multi-cloud environment. It acts as the **fault-tolerant mission control** for critical ML workloads.

**Real-World Problem It Solves:**

- Guarantees **zero data loss** and **ultra-fast recovery** (MTTR < 90s) across cloud boundaries despite node failures.
- Conducts empirical analysis on **cross-cloud network impact** on consensus protocols (Raft) and data movement.
- Optimizes data flow to achieve **10+ GB/s sustained throughput** for massive training jobs.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Functional Requirements (Refined)

### Core Data Movement & Processing

- **MapReduce Core:** Specialized processing engine for parallel Map (compute) and synchronous Reduce (aggregation) tasks.
- **Durable State Persistence:** All intermediate and final data is written immediately to globally accessible, durable cloud storage (S3/GCS).
- **Data Integrity:** Compute verifiable checksums on all processed data and final output.

### System Management (Consensus-Driven)

- **Fault-Tolerant Coordination:** Orchestrator Control Plane maintains state using a **Raft-like consensus algorithm**.
- **Adaptive Failover:** Implement and measure **Warm Standby** (CPU-only VM pre-provisioned) failover to minimize RTO while managing GPU cost.
- **Cost-RTO Analysis:** Empirically measure the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) against the operational cost of different failover strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture (Refactored)

**Components:**

- **Consensus Control Plane ($\mathbf{Raft\text{-}Managed}$):** The replicated state machine (AWS, GCP, Azure) that maintains the **Global Task Manifest** and handles Leader Election/Failover.
- **Task Scheduler:** Service that assigns tasks (Map/Reduce) to Node Agents based on the **Load Balancer** policy.
- **Node Agents:** Worker processes on each compute node responsible for $\mathbf{Map}/\mathbf{Reduce}$ execution and health reporting.
- **Durable Storage Manager:** Coordinates immediate writing of all intermediate/final results to neutral cloud storage (S3/GCS) and manages **Checkpoints**.
- **Metrics Collector:** Performance monitoring and alerting (Prometheus/Grafana).

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Distributed Consensus:** Raft protocol for fault-tolerant state management and rapid Leader failover.
- **Decoupled Compute:** Warm Standby VMs (CPU-only) used to achieve fast RTO while managing GPU cost.
- **Idempotent MapReduce:** All workers write results to durable storage, allowing failed tasks to be safely re-run without duplication.
- **Multi-Cloud Network Awareness:** Routing decisions, Raft timeouts, and load balancing are adapted based on measured cross-cloud latency.

##### ML Workload Integration Effort (Post-Sprint 2 Core)

This table outlines the additional, focused effort required to adapt the core MapReduce engine for diverse ML workloads.

| ML Model                     | Primary Work Required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Effort Estimate            |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Matrix Multiplication**    | _0% (Already complete as the MapReduce core validation workload)_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | N/A                        |
| **CNN (Plate Recognition)**  | Low to Moderate. Adapt the **Ingestion Engine** for image files, perform basic preprocessing (resize/normalize), and convert them into GPU-friendly tensors. Map workers need logic to run the pre-trained model's forward/backward pass.                                                           | ~4â€“6 points (1â€“1.5 days)   |
| **Kaggle Protein Structure** | Moderate. Adapt the **Ingestion Engine** to parse sequence/graph data (e.g., FASTA/PDB files) and convert them into domain-specific embeddings or graph structures. This involves specialized libraries.                                                                                            | ~6â€“8 points (1.5â€“2 days)   |
| **Chatbot/LLM**              | Moderate to High. Adapt **Ingestion** for tokenization and sequence padding. The **Map Worker** must handle the complex gradient synchronization (**All-Reduce**) that stresses the network, often requiring specific high-performance communication libraries (like NCCL or custom gRPC handlers). | ~10â€“13 points (2.5â€“3 days) |

The kaggle competition ML model is on the way to done. I think there is stanford question/answer dataset we can use to train the chatbot, and I need to src probably about 1000 images of plates and label them for the CNN. So a not insubstantial amount of data for the project. Anyways starting anew.
